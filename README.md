If you don't have an OpenAI key, follow the instructions below:

Login to OpenAI website and go to the API section.
Click the Personal tab on the top right of your screen, and navigate to View API keys section.
Click on `Create new secret key button`, give a nickname and copy the API Key that shows up.
Make sure to backup the key somewhere and keep it safe since OpenAI will now show you the complete key again.
Voila! You can now use your very own API key for using OpenAI API's within your applications.

NOTE : Free accounts have a 15$ API limit passing which you will either have to create a new account or take the premium subscription.
